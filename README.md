# MERN Application (Mongo, Express, React, Node)

## Technology Overview:

### Mongo:
MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database.
- means you can store JSON documents in it, and the structure of these documents can vary as it is not enforced like SQL databases. 
- This is one of the advantages of using NoSQL as it speeds up application development and reduces the complexity of deployments.

### Mongoose for MongoDB:
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
