# MERN Application (Mongo, Express, React, Node)

## Technology Overview:

### React
JS library for building UI's

### Node
Node is a runtime environment that incorporates server-side tools in JS

### Express
Express is a popular Node Web framework.  
- Writes handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).

### Axios
JS library that streamlines error handling in HTTP requests.

### Mongo ( Cluster in Cloud thanks to AWS, max 1 GB ):
MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database.
- Means you can store JSON documents in it, and the structure of these documents can vary as it is not enforced like SQL databases. 
- This is one of the advantages of using NoSQL as it speeds up application development and reduces the complexity of deployments.

### Mongoose for MongoDB:
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

-- Attempted to use CanvasJS 4/7 though had difficulty with import/export statements.  Further research showed compatibility issues addmitted by vendor, so I ditched it.
